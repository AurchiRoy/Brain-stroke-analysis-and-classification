# Description


This project uses machine learning to predict brain stroke risk by analyzing key factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle attributes. Strokes are often detected too late for effective intervention, but machine learning can help identify subtle patterns in patient data that may indicate early stroke risk. Using a dataset from Kaggle with 43,400 entries and 12 features, the project aims to develop an accurate predictive model, potentially allowing for earlier medical intervention, better outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs.
